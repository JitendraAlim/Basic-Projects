# Drug Price Analysis

Refer to the accompanying **Drug Price Discount** data, which includes Drug Price Discount (fictitious) demanded by Japan from companies, Japan’s GDP Growth %, and Japan’s Health Care Spending as a % of GDP.  Using this data:

* Form a regression equation to explain Drug Price Discount in terms of macro-economic and industry variables.
* Choose at least one other (other than GDP Growth and Health Care Spending as a % of GDP) relevant country-level variable and incorporate in your equation
* Use the regression model to forecast average drug price discounts in the next 3-5 years. Make appropriate adjustments for trend, if any. Take into consideration various regression 'pitfalls' including multicollinearity.
* Incorporate your findings from the equation in your write-up
* Describe your regression model in the appendix.

Provide rationale for the expected values of the explanatory variables.  
Justify your views, if they differ from those from the published sources.  
Discuss interpretation of R-square and p-values etc.  
Show the past fit of in-sample estimates and the model accuracy reflected by the average absolute in-sample error.
