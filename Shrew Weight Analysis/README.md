# Shrew Weight Analysis

Data on greater white-toothed shrews (Crocidura russula) which were caught during two trapping periods in gardens in and around a village in the Swiss Alps. The data were collected by MSc students from the University of Lausanne (Switzerland). The data in the file appear as they were entered in the field. Missing data appear as NA. Pregnant female shrews have been removed from the data set.

**Task**: 

* Test whether there is a difference in weight between male and female greater white toothed shrews (i.e. do they show sexual dimorphism in body weight).
* Do juvenile shrews differ from adult shrews in their pattern of sexual dimorphism in terms of body weight?
